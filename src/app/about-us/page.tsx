            <Subtitle className="text-lg">
              Founded by Dr. Emma Larsson, a naturopathic physician with over 20
              years of experience, Flourish & Flow was born from a vision to
              create a space where traditional and modern healing practices
              could coexist harmoniously. Dr. Larsson's journey began in her
              native Sweden, where she was introduced to the concept of "lagom"
              - the art of balanced living. This philosophy, combined with the
              ideas of flourishing and flowing, became the cornerstone of our
              center.
